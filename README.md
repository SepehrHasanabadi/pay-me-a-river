## Overview

This project is a simple money transfer system that allows users to transfer money to another user, and the receiver can claim the transferred amount at their convenience. The unique feature of this system is that the receiver can claim the money whenever they want within a specified time period, but the remaining amount cannot be claimed by the receiver.

Aptos, a digital currency, is used for transferring the coins securely within the system. Aptos provides a decentralized and efficient way to facilitate transactions, ensuring the privacy and security of users' financial data.
